### Week 1 review
* For the first week we achieved all our goals except getting the code for the robot moving forward
at this point i am unsure if Arnold or Harry have written code and not uploaded to github or have simply not started. A team
meeting is in order to see what work has been done by who.

### We are excluding the mid trimester break

## Week two goals:
* Harry, Arnold and James produce code for Quadrant one
* James works on network code
* Thomas and Tom finalise chassis and chassis design

###Week 2 review

## Week 3 goals:
