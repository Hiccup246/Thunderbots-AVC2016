## Team Milestones

|Week|                     Milestones                      |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 1  |~~To complete the team plan~~                        |
| 2  |~~To have the robot follow a line(curved or straight) and have the chassis built~~|
| 3  |~~To navigate through qadrant 2 and open the network gate~~|
| 4  |~~To Navigate through quadrant 3~~                   |
| 5  |~~To navigate through quadrant 4~~                   |
| 6  |~~Completion and report.~~                           |



### Week one Goals:

~~All- Working on Plan due friday~~

~~Thomas- Manage team via google docs~~

~~Tom/Thomas- Need to be thinking about the chassis and first draft~~

~~Harry/Arnold- Devaloping code to move robot forward and processing images~~

~~James- Managing github and devaloping code for network gate~~

### Week 1 review
* For the first week we achieved all our goals except getting the code for the robot moving forward
at this point i am unsure if Arnold or Harry have written code and not uploaded to github or have simply not started. A team
meeting is in order to see what work has been done by who.

### We are excluding the mid trimester break

## Week two goals:
* Harry, Arnold and James produce code for Quadrant one
* ~~James works on network code~~
* ~~Thomas and Tom finalise chassis and chassis design~~

###Week 2 review
* James has finished network code and is ready to test it
* Tom and Thomas have finalised chassis
* Harry and Arnold have finished writing the quadrant 1 code which is now ready for testing
* Only goal for week 3 which was not met was to completet the code for quadrant one
* Behind due to inability to test code as chassis is not done

## Week 3 goals:
* Harry,Arnold and James Writing code to get up to b- but preferably finish line and start on maze

* Harry,Arnold and James Testing all code

* ~~Thomas and Tom FINISH CHASSIS ASAP~~

* ~~Team meeting~~

* Whole team looking at code performing touch-ups and debugging
### Week 3 review
* After extensive mis-communications the hardware has finally been finished
* however the robot can still not complete quadrant 2 and 3. We have tested our code and
* are %100 confident that it will make it through quadant 1. Overall a very productive week.
* i will mention that because only two weeks remain the presure is on.

## Friday Night Goals
* Make code to navigate intersections
* Make code to navigate 90 degree turns
* Make code so that it turns 180 degrees at a dead end
* Make sure it can semi reliably navigate the Quadrants 1,2 and 3.


## Week 4 goals:
* Complete quadrants 2 and 3
* If time permits attemp quadrant 4
* Write code to navigate junctions
* Write code to make 90degree turns and navigate dead ends
* Test all code and make sure it is presentable in week 5
*

### Week 4 review:
* Code written for quadrants 2 and 3, but require more testing 
* Network code written but requires testing (Lab Time)
* Minor Hardware issues fixed

## Week 5 goals:
* Test and run code, validate each quadrant
* Refining any software issues
* Testing PID
* Eliminating any possilbe hardware faults

## Week 5 review:
* Reviewed software and hardware, making everything up to standard.
* Completed the trial and passsed with 75.5% (Quadrants 1, 2, and 3, with a partial into quardant 4).
* Reviewed hardware and was deducted 3% due to minor discrepencies to Hardware design.
